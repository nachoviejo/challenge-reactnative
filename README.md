## About The Challenge

We want to develop a small mobile application that allows users to view the content of an api.

* First, we will show the list of chapters following the figma layout. The data will be loaded from the provided API.
* A search bar is required. Filter chapters and check if they don't exist.
* When clicking on a chapter, the details of the chapter will be displayed on the same screen, as popUp.
* The application will have a navigation bar, which will start at home (The chapter search engine)
* A custom developer tab will be displayed in Account (detailed in figma)
* Figma design: <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/E3Kh1BUuwpXiAZSZ8zMLem/Mobile-Challenge?node-id=0%3A1">Design</a>
